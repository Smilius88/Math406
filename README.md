Welcome!

This is code for MATH406, Spring 2015, Dr. Wiseley Wong. If you're not in the class,
don't worry. I hope you'll find something interesting.

There is currently only one module, math406. This contains implementations of
algorithms we studied in class. I'm particularly proud of lift, and of solve_poly_con.

I wrote all this code from scratch. The text I used was Kenneth Rosen, *Elementary Number Theory*.

In future I will add more algorithms as we discuss them in class. I will also add
comments to clarify the code.
